      question: "How do I answer 'Tell me about yourself' in a job interview?",
      answer:
        "When answering 'Tell me about yourself,' structure your response in three parts:\n\n1. **Present**: Start with your current role and responsibilities\n2. **Past**: Briefly mention relevant past experiences\n3. **Future**: Express your interest in the role you're interviewing for\n\nKeep your answer concise (1-2 minutes) and focused on professional experiences relevant to the position. Avoid oversharing personal details.\n\nExample: *'I'm currently a Senior Developer at TechCorp, where I lead a team of five engineers building cloud-based solutions. Before that, I spent three years at StartupX developing their core platform. I'm particularly proud of implementing a CI/CD pipeline that reduced deployment time by 40%. I'm now looking to bring my technical leadership and cloud expertise to a larger organization like yours.'*",
